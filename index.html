  <h1>Steam Deckommendations</h1>
  <p align="center">Howdy. I spent a lot of time researching &amp; sorting through Steam Deck products &amp;
    modifications when I
    bought an LCD model in March 2023. I did quite a few modifications to it before upgrading as soon as the OLED models
    came out that November.<br><br>
    Since Steam Deck is gaining popularity lately, I thought it might be helpful to put together a list. I often find
    myself trying to decide which few products to point people towards. Now, I can just send this list.</p>

  <h2>Notes:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I've only listed <b>products I've personally tried</b>.</li>
    <li>Prices might've changed since time of writing.</li>
    <li>Priority Legend
      <ul>
        <li>🟢 Essential. Basically everyone should get.</li>
        <li>🟡 Improves user experience, but can get by w/o</li>
        <li>🔴 Only necessary if you're personally into it</li>
        <li>⚫ Fully unnecessary</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><u>Important Note</u>: Priority is <b>NOT</b> a measure of how good the product is, but <b>how necessary</b> is
      is for a better user experience (in my opinion).</li>
    <li>OLED vs. non-OLED compatibility<br>
      All products are compatible for both OLED &amp; non-OLED models of Steam Deck unless explicitly stated otherwise.
      I've personally owned both models &amp; can personally vouch for compatibility

    <h2>Dbrand</h2>
    <a class="product" href="https://dbrand.com/shop/killswitch/steam-deck-cases">Killswitch Essential Bundle</a>
    [$59.95]🟢 👑<br>
    <ul>
      <p><u>Type</u>: Cosmetic | Functional</p>
      <p>Essential Bundle: Case + Kickstand + Skin</p>
      <p>
        <u>Notes</u>: If you could only buy one thing for your Deck, it should be the Killswitch. $60 might seem a tad
        high (maybe, idk ur financial situation), but the quality is insane.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <p>
          <li>
            Case: simply one of the most well-constructed cases for anything I've ever used. It has a mount on the back
            that supports several add-ons from Dbrand as well as other companies like <a
              href="#mechanism">Mechanism</a>.
          </li>
        </p>
        <p>
          <li>
            Kickstand: fits into the mechanical mount. Not flimsy like Switch's built-in stand. Has slots for 4 microSD
            cards. So nice.
          </li>
        </p>
        <p>
          <li>
            Adhesive Skin: a ton of skin colors &amp; patterns to choose from. They look very nice, but you will
            probably
            cry installing it. I've taken multiple Steam Decks fully apart and installing the Dbrand skin is the thing I
            dread the most.
          </li>
        </p>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <p align="center">The following are individual add-ons you can add get when you buy a Killswitch. I've listed
      individual prices,
      but they're cheaper if you get the Travel/Ultra bundles.</p>

    <span class="product">Screen Protectors (2-pack)</span> [$19.95]🟢<br>
    <ul>
      <p><u>Type</u>: Functional</p>
      <p><u>Notes</u>: Please get this</p>
    </ul>

    <span class="product">Killswitch Travel Cover</span> [$14.95]🟢<br>
    <ul>
      <p><u>Type</u>: Functional</p>
      <p><u>Notes</u>: Super nice hard plastic shield that fits over the front of the Killswitch. Completely protects
        the analogs &amp; screen. Not necessarily a replacement for a full travel case, but pretty close. I always put
        mine on when I'm not playing.
      </p>
    </ul>

    <span class="product">Universal Mechanical Mount</span> [$19.95]🟡<br>
    <ul>
      <p><u>Type</u>: Functional</p>
      <p><u>Notes</u>: Fits into the mount on Killswitch. Afix whatever to it with the velcro strap or 3M patch. I've
        still never used the 3M. I bought an enormous pretty heavy external <a href="#baseus">Baseus</a> battery &amp;
        the velcro holds it no problem.</p>
    </ul>

    <span class="product">Stick Grips</span> [$9.95]🔴<br>
    <ul>
      <p><u>Type</u>: Functional</p>
      <p>
        <u>Notes</u>: Grips that go over your analogs. Somehow still allow the touch + gyro sensors on the analogs to
        work. Magic? They're cool &amp; feel nice &amp; I like them but if you are like me you will lose several pairs.
        Ferrets like to steal them.
      </p>
    </ul>

    <span class="product">Dock Adapter Kit</span> [$7.95]
    <ul>
      <br>🟢 If you plan on getting Valve <a href="#valve">Steam Deck Dock</a>.
      <br>⚫ If not

      <p><u>Type</u>: Cosmetic | Functional</p>

      <p>
        <u>Notes</u>: Watched some videos benchmarking metrics comparing various deck dock performance. There were
        pros & cons for all. Official dock's primary pro over 3rd-party docks seemed to be lowest latency for input
        which felt like the most important thing for me.

    <h2>Deck Buttons</h2>

    <a class="product" href="https://deckbuttons.com/collections/all-button-sets">Replacement Button Sets</a> [$39.99 -
    $65.00]🟡
    <br>

    <ul>
      <u>Type</u>: Cosmetic | Functional | Modification<br>
      <p>
        <u>Notes</u>: Personally my favorite product/company of this list. Truly the final level of making your deck
        stand out in my opinion. There's so many cool designs, both in terms of pattern and material. You can literally
        have brass buttons dude. There's buttons with actual sprinkles. Buttons with (ethically sourced) DEAD BUGS. like
        bro what<br><br>
        And they don't JUST look cool, I could genuinely never go back to stock buttons ESPECIALLY on the LCD model. the
        OLED's stock buttons are an improvement, but the Deck Buttons still blow them out of the water. Premium
        af.<br><br>
        Its a very small operation, so stock is constantly changing and if you want a particular set, you'll probably
        wanna sign up for the newsletter, but there's usually always at least some sets up.<br><br>
        Importantly, you have to be comfortable with getting into the guts of your deck. If you're completely
        uncomfortable with opening it up, the button sets aren't for you. Personally, I'd never really done too much
        with
        hardware & I was able to manage it with a clear guide. There's nothing spooky like soldering. The hardest part
        is
        separating the plastic shell. BUY <a href="#ifixit">THE PLASTIC SPATULA THING</a> FOR THIS. After that, as long
        as
        you're careful, it's genuinely pretty easy. I believe in you. Also buy a little magnetic bowl for tiny screws.
      </p>
    </ul>

    <a class="product" href="https://deckbuttons.com/collections/all-button-sets">Touch Protect</a> [$12.95]🟡
    <ul>
      <p><u>Type</u>: Cosmetic | Functional</p>
      <p>
        <u>Notes</u>: Highly recommend these. They look cool & they add a super nice sensory feeling to the
        trackpads/back grips that's completely different depending on what pattern you get.

        <u>Notes</u>: Gives a few extra hours of battery life. There's definitely a bunch of external power banks that
        will work obviously. This is just the one I use & can confirm works.
        I have had some issues with the Deck not wanting to charge with chargers that theoretically should've been able
        to handle it.

    <ul>
      <p><u>Type</u>: Functional</p>
      <p><u>Notes</u>: I was extremely surprised at how revolutionary this was for me. I have a problem where my hands
        go
        super numb pretty quickly when I hold stuff (idk its prbly fine). Using the Deck at times was basically
        impossible. Not only does this pillow mount solve that problem, it's become a thing I use 100% of the time.</p>

      <u>Type</u>: Functional
      <u>Notes</u>: idk if i'm simply daft or overthinking it, but i had to spend quite awhile looking at the site
      trying
      to make sure i understood the products i needed to make this ecosystem fit together. to use the pillow
      specifically,
      you need ONE of these:
      <ul>

          it attaches with adhesive maybe idk</li>

    <h2>JSAUX</h2>

    <p align="center">
      JSAUX has a ton of Steam Deck products. Personally, although they're definitely good products, my search always
      ended up leading me to a seemingly better alternative elsewhere for most things.
    </p>

    <a class="product"
      href="https://jsaux.com/products/transparent-back-plate-for-steam-deck-pc0106?variant=43781193367772">Transparent
      Back Plate</a> [$12.99]🔴
    <br>

    <ul>
      <p><u>Type</u>: Cosmetic | Functional | Modification</p>
      <p><u>NOT COMPATIBLE WITH OLED❗❗❗</u></p>
      <p>Feels like they're selling off all LCD stock currently?</p>
      <p>
        <u>Notes</u>: Really cool looking transparent colored back plate that resembles the classic N64 style. I
        got the purple variant, but that doesn't seem available at time of writing.<br><br>

        The blackplate adds an extra thermal pad over the CPU area + a larger vent section. Not sure whether
        benchmarks show it helps, but I'm sure someone's tested this.<br><br>

        The big drawback is if you keep your Deck in a case like the Killswitch 100% of the time, you never actually
        get to enjoy the aesthetic benefits of it lol. I probably wouldn't bother buying it again tbh.<br><br>

        <b>However</b>, in my opinion, the best part about this isn't the back plate at all, but the extended back
        button mods. These felt soooo nice. If you have an LCD model, I'd highly recommend. They were compatible with
        Killswitch. I wish they sold these separately in an OLED compatible model.

      <p>
        <u>Notes</u>: This recommendation is a bit outdated, but might be useful info for someone idk. I figured
        I'd at least list the exact SSD that worked for me in the LCD model.<br><br>
        One thing you could do to save money pre-OLED was buy the LCD Deck model that came with 64GB of storage. It
        didn't have an SSD installed like the other models. You could save $150 or so by just installing your own.
        Plus, there were no 1TB models, so you saved money AND got more internal storage than you could buy
        otherwise. It seems there are no models that come with no internal SSD these days and the 1TB model is only
        $100 more than the 512GB, so you literally wouldn't save money anyway. Alas. MicroSDs are easier anyway.
