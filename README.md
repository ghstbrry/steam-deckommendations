# Steam Deckommendations

Howdy. I spent a lot of time researching & sorting through Steam Deck products & modifications when I bought an LCD model in March 2023. I did quite a few modifications to it before upgrading as soon as the OLED models came out that November.<br><br>
Since Steam Deck is gaining popularity lately, I thought it might be helpful to put together a list. I often find myself trying to decide which few products to point people towards. Now, I can just send this list. :3

## Notes:
- I've only listed **products I've personally tried**.

- Prices might've changed since time of writing.

- Priority Legend
  - üü¢ Essential. Basically everyone should get.
  - üü° Improves user experience, but can get by w/o    
  - üî¥ Only necessary if you're personally into it
  - ‚ö´ Fully unnecessary  
  
  <u>Important Note</u>: Priority is **NOT** a measure of how good the product is, but **how necessary** is is for a better user experience (in my opinion).

- OLED vs. non-OLED compatibility  
All products are compatible for both OLED & non-OLED models of Steam Deck unless explicitly stated otherwise. I've personally owned both models & can personally vouch for compatibility

### Dbrand
- <u>[**Killswitch Essential Bundle**](https://dbrand.com/shop/killswitch/steam-deck-cases)</u> [$59.95]<br>
üü¢ üëë 
  - <u>Type</u>: Cosmetic | Functional
  - Essential Bundle: Case + Kickstand + Skin
  - <u>Notes</u>: If you could only buy one thing for your Deck, it should be the Killswitch. $60 might seem a tad high (maybe, idk ur financial situation), but the quality is insane.<br><br>
    - Case: simply one of the most well-constructed cases for anything I've ever used. It has a mount on the back that supports several add-ons from Dbrand as well as other companies like [Mechanism](#mechanism).<br><br>
    - Kickstand: fits into the mechanical mount. Not flimsy like Switch's built-in stand. Has slots for 4 microSD cards. So nice.<br><br>
    - Adhesive Skin: a ton of skin colors & patterns to choose from. They look very nice, but you will probably cry installing it. I've taken multiple Steam Decks fully apart and installing the Dbrand skin is the thing I dread the most. 

- The Following are individual add-ons you can add get when you buy a Killswitch. I've listed individual prices, but they're cheaper if you get the Travel/Ultra bundles.

- <u>**Screen Protectors (2-pack)**</u> [$19.95]<br>
üü¢
  - <u>Type</u>: Functional
  - <u>Notes</u>: Please get this

- <u>**Killswitch Travel Cover**</u> [$14.95]<br>
üü¢ 
  - <u>Type</u>: Functional
  - <u>Notes</u>: Super nice hard plastic shield that fits over the front of the Killswitch. Completely protects the analogs & screen. Not necessarily a replacement for a full travel case, but pretty close. I always put mine on when I'm not playing.

- <u>**Universal Mechanical Mount**</u> [$19.95]<br>
üü°
  - <u>Type</u>: Functional
  - <u>Notes</u>: Fits into the mount on Killswitch. Afix whatever to it with the velcro strap or 3M patch. I've still never used the 3M. I bought an enormous pretty heavy external [Baseus](#baseus) battery & the velcro holds it no problem.

- <u>**Stick Grips**</u> [$9.95]<br>
üî¥
  - <u>Type</u>: Functional
  - <u>Notes</u>: Grips that go over your analogs. Somehow still allow the touch + gyro sensors on the analogs to work. Magic? They're cool & feel nice & I like them but if you are like me you will lose several pairs. Ferrets like to steal them.

- <u>**Dock Adapter Kit**</u> [$7.95]<br>
üü¢ If you plan on getting Valve [Steam Deck Dock](#valve).  
‚ö´ If not
  - <u>Type</u>: Cosmetic | Functional
  - <u>Notes</u>: Makes it so the deck fits on the official dock with Killswitch on

### Valve
- <u>[**Steam Deck Dock**](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeckdock)</u> [$79.00]<br>
üü¢ If you plan on playing on a TV ever.  
‚ö´ If you only ever expect to play handheld.
<br><br>
  - <u>Notes</u>: Watched some videos benchmarking metrics comparing various deck dock performance. There were pros & cons for all. Official dock's primary pro over 3rd-party docks seemed to be lowest latency for input which felt like the most important thing for me.
<br><br>

### Deck Buttons
- <u>[**Replacement Button Sets**](https://deckbuttons.com/collections/all-button-sets)</u> [$39.99 - $65.00]<br>
üü°  
  - <u>Type</u>: Cosmetic | Functional | Modification
  - <u>Notes</u>: Personally my favorite product/company of this list. Truly the final level of making your deck stand out in my opinion. There's so many cool designs, both in terms of pattern and material. You can literally have brass buttons dude. There's buttons with actual sprinkles. Buttons with (ethically sourced) DEAD BUGS. like bro what<br><br>
  And they don't JUST look cool, I could genuinely never go back to stock buttons ESPECIALLY on the LCD model. the OLED's stock buttons are an improvement, but the Deck Buttons still blow them out of the water. Premium af.<br><br>
  Its a very small operation, so stock is constantly changing and if you want a particular set, you'll probably wanna sign up for the newsletter, but there's usually always at least some sets up.<br><br>
  Importantly, you have to be comfortable with getting into the guts of your deck. If you're completely uncomfortable with opening it up, the button sets aren't for you. Personally, I'd never really done too much with hardware & I was able to manage it with a clear guide. There's nothing spooky like soldering. The hardest part is separating the plastic shell. BUY [THE PLASTIC SPATULA THING](#ifixit) FOR THIS. After that, as long as you're careful, it's genuinely pretty easy. I believe in you. Also buy a little magnetic bowl for tiny screws.

- <u>[**Touch Protect**](https://deckbuttons.com/collections/all-button-sets)</u> [$12.95]<br>
üü°  
  - <u>Type</u>: Cosmetic | Functional
  - <u>Notes</u>: Highly recommend these. They look cool & they add a super nice sensory feeling to the trackpads/back grips that's completely different depending on what pattern you get.

### Baseus
- <u>[**Power Bank 65W 20000mAh**](https://www.baseus.com/products/adaman-power-bank-65w-20000mah)</u> [$49.99]<br>
üü¢  
  - <u>Type</u>: Functional
  - <u>Notes</u>: Gives a few extra hours of battery life. There's definitely a bunch of external power banks that will work obviously. This is just the one I use & can confirm works.<br><br>
  I have had some issues with the Deck not wanting to charge with chargers that theoretically should've been able to handle it which is why I figured I'd list this bank that I can 100% confirm works.

### Mechanism
- <u>[**Gaming Pillow**](https://getmechanism.com/products/gaming-pillow)</u> [$59.00]<br>
üü¢  
  - <u>Type</u>: Functional
  - <u>Notes</u>: I was extremely surprised at how revolutionary this was for me. I have a problem where my hands go super numb pretty quickly when I hold stuff (idk its prbly fine). Using the Deck at times was basically impossible. Not only does this pillow mount solve that problem, it's become a thing I use 100% of the time.<br><br>

- <u>[**Adapter for Killswitch**](https://getmechanism.com/products/mechanism-adapter-for-steam-deck-killswitch)</u> [$9.00]<br>
üü¢  
  - <u>Type</u>: Functional
  - <u>Notes</u>: idk if i'm simply daft or overthinking it, but i had to spend quite awhile looking at the site trying to make sure i understood the products i needed to make this ecosystem fit together. to use the pillow specifically, you need ONE of these:
    - Adapter for Killswitch if you have a Killswitch (duh) 
    - the [DeckMate Grip](https://getmechanism.com/products/deckmate-grip-1-5) if you're raw dogging it (why are you doing this and also sorry for saying raw dogging)
    - the [Universal Adapter](https://getmechanism.com/products/universal-adapter-1-5) which seems like it attaches with adhesive maybe idk
    - there's also probably other ways idk you just need a grip/mount, okay<br>

- <u>[**Phone Mount**](https://getmechanism.com/products/phone-mount?variant=44393656615169)</u> [$25.00]<br>
üî¥  
  - <u>Type</u>: Functional
  - <u>Notes</u>: Comes with magnet adhesive thing. Adhesive side of magnet thing sticks to back of phone. Magnet side sticks to circle end of Phone Mount. other side of Phone Mount attaches to bottom of gaming pillow (or back of Deck). now you watch Subway Surfers while you play Fortnite. may god have mercy on your rotten soul.

### iFixIt
- <u>[**Essential Electronics Toolkit**](https://www.ifixit.com/products/essential-electronics-toolkit)</u> [$29.95]<br>
üî¥
  - <u>Type</u>: Functional | Modification
  - <u>Notes</u>: If you get any of the things that require you to open up the Deck, you want this. I still don't have a nice big plastic spatula thing and I curse myself every day for it.

### JSAUX

JSAUX has a ton of Steam Deck products. Personally, although they're definitely good products, my search always ended up leading me to a seemingly better alternative elsewhere for most things.

- <u>[**Transparent Back Plate**](https://jsaux.com/products/transparent-back-plate-for-steam-deck-pc0106?variant=43781193367772)</u> [$12.99]<br>
üî¥
  - <u>Type</u>: Cosmetic | Functional | Modification
  - <u>NOT COMPATIBLE WITH OLED‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó</u>
  - Feels like they're selling off all LCD stock currently?
  - <u>Notes</u>: Really cool looking transparent colored back plate that resembles the classic N64 style. I got the purple variant, but that doesn't seem available at time of writing.
<br><br>
The blackplate adds an extra thermal pad over the CPU area + a larger vent section. Not sure whether benchmarks show it helps, but I'm sure someone's tested this.
<br><br>
The big drawback is if you keep your Deck in a case like the Killswitch 100% of the time, you never actually get to enjoy the aesthetic benefits of it lol. I probably wouldn't bother buying it again tbh.
<br><br>
**However**, in my opinion, the best part about this isn't the back plate at all, but the extended back button mods. These felt soooo nice. If you have an LCD model, I'd recommend. They were compatible with Killswitch. I wish they sold these separately in an OLED compatible model.

### Sabrent
- <u>[**Rocket 2230 1TB NVMe SSD**](https://sabrent.com/products/sb-2130-1tb)</u> [$99.99]<br>
üî¥
  - <u>Type</u>: Functional | Modification
  - **Outdated**
  - <u>Notes</u>: This recommendation is a bit outdated, but might be useful info for someone idk. I figured I'd at least list the exact SSD that worked for me in the LCD model.<br><br>
  One thing you could do to save money pre-OLED was buy the LCD Deck model that came with 64GB of storage. It didn't have an SSD installed like the other models. You could save $150 or so by just installing your own. Plus, there were no 1TB models, so you saved money AND got more internal storage than you could buy otherwise. It seems there are no models that come with no internal SSD these days and the 1TB model is only $100 more than the 512GB, so you literally wouldn't save money anyway. Alas. MicroSDs are easier anyway. Speaking of,

### SanDisk
- <u>[**Sandisk microSDXC Extreme Pro 1TB**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RKL6PK9)</u> [$115.87]<br>
üü°
  - <u>Type</u>: Functional
  - <u>Notes</u>: Not all microSDs are created equal. these are the kind you want.
